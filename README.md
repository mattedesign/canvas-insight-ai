## ü§ñ Context-Aware Analysis System

### How It Works

1. **Context Detection Phase**
   - Analyzes uploaded image to detect interface type (dashboard, landing page, app, etc.)
   - Identifies domain (finance, healthcare, e-commerce, etc.)
   - Infers user role and expertise from natural language input

2. **Dynamic Prompt Generation**
   - Builds custom prompts based on detected context
   - Adapts language complexity to user expertise level
   - Includes domain-specific requirements automatically

3. **Multi-Model Execution**
   - Runs available AI models in parallel
   - Fuses insights from multiple models
   - Calculates confidence scores

4. **Personalized Output**
   - Formats results based on user role (technical vs business language)
   - Prioritizes recommendations by user preference (impact, effort, quick wins)
   - Shows detected context transparently

### Supported Interface Types

- **Dashboard**: Data visualization, metrics, KPI tracking
- **Landing Page**: Conversion optimization, messaging, CTAs
- **Mobile App**: Touch targets, gestures, mobile-specific patterns
- **E-commerce**: Product presentation, cart flow, trust signals
- **Forms**: Field validation, completion optimization
- **SaaS**: Onboarding, feature discovery, user retention
- **Portfolio**: Visual presentation, case studies
- **Content**: Readability, information architecture

### User Roles & Adaptations

- **Designers**: Focus on visual hierarchy, aesthetics, design systems
- **Developers**: Component architecture, performance, implementation
- **Business**: ROI, conversion metrics, growth opportunities
- **Product**: Feature adoption, user journeys, roadmap implications
- **Marketing**: Messaging, brand consistency, SEO considerations

## ü§ñ AI Rules of Engagement

### Core Principles for AI Analysis

1. **Context-Aware Analysis**: Always detect and adapt to the interface type and user role before providing insights
2. **No Generic Feedback**: Every analysis must be specifically tailored to the detected context - never use one-size-fits-all responses
3. **Evidence-Based**: Support all recommendations with specific UI elements, established UX principles, and industry standards
4. **Role-Appropriate Language**: Adapt technical level based on user expertise (developer vs business stakeholder vs designer)
5. **Actionable Specificity**: Provide precise, implementable suggestions with clear steps, not vague improvements

### Context Detection Requirements

- **Always Run First**: Context detection must complete before any analysis begins
- **Display Transparently**: Show users what was detected (interface type, domain, user role)
- **Adapt Dynamically**: Use detected context to build custom prompts for each stage
- **Industry Standards**: Automatically include relevant compliance checks (WCAG for all, HIPAA for healthcare, PCI-DSS for finance)

### Analysis Focus by Interface Type

**Dashboards**
- Data visualization effectiveness and cognitive load
- Information hierarchy and decision support
- Real-time data handling and performance

**Landing Pages**
- Conversion optimization and psychological triggers
- Message clarity and value proposition
- Trust signals and social proof

**Mobile Apps**
- Touch target sizing (minimum 44x44px)
- Gesture patterns and thumb reach
- Platform-specific guidelines (iOS HIG, Material Design)

**E-commerce**
- Purchase journey and cart abandonment factors
- Product presentation and comparison features
- Security perception and payment trust

**Forms**
- Field validation and error recovery
- Completion optimization and progress indicators
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation

### Output Adaptation Rules

**For Developers**
- Include component architecture insights
- Provide code-level implementation hints
- Focus on performance implications
- Use technical terminology freely

**For Designers**
- Emphasize visual hierarchy and aesthetics
- Reference design system opportunities
- Focus on emotional design impact
- Include creative alternatives

**For Business Stakeholders**
- Lead with ROI and conversion impact
- Use business metrics and KPIs
- Avoid technical jargon
- Focus on competitive advantages

**For Product Managers**
- Balance user needs with feasibility
- Include roadmap considerations
- Focus on feature adoption
- Provide prioritization frameworks

### Quality Requirements

- **Quantifiable**: Include specific metrics (e.g., "Increase button size to 48px" not "Make button bigger")
- **Prioritized**: Mark issues as Critical, High, Medium, or Low based on user impact
- **Confidence-Rated**: Show confidence levels for AI-generated insights
- **Multi-Model Validated**: When multiple models agree, highlight consensus findings

### Error Handling Principles

- **Specific Errors Only**: Never show generic error messages
- **Actionable Solutions**: Every error must tell users exactly how to fix it
- **No Fallback Content**: If analysis fails, explain why - don't show placeholder data
- **Transparent Limitations**: Be clear about what requires which API keys

## üìä API Configuration

### Recommended Setup
For best results, configure multiple API keys:
- **OpenAI + Anthropic**: Provides diverse perspectives and highest quality
- **All Three APIs**: Maximum insight coverage and model consensus

### Single API Mode
The system works with just one API key but with reduced capabilities:
- Fewer models means less comprehensive analysis
- Lower confidence scores
- Reduced ability to cross-validate findings

### No API Keys
Without API keys, the system will:
- Show clear error messages explaining what's needed
- Direct users to settings to add API keys
- Never show generic or fallback content

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **No Fallback Data**: Never show generic responses - only real AI insights
2. **Context First**: Always detect and display context before analysis
3. **Transparent Errors**: Show specific, actionable error messages
4. **Dynamic Everything**: No hardcoded prompts or generic templates
5. **User-Centric**: Adapt to expertise level and goals

### Code Standards

```typescript
// Always use context-aware prompts
const prompt = promptBuilder.buildContextualPrompt(
  stage,
  analysisContext,
  previousData
);

// Never use generic error messages
// ‚ùå Bad: "Analysis failed. Please try again."
// ‚úÖ Good: "Analysis failed: OpenAI API key not configured. Add it in Settings."

// Always include context in results
return {
  ...analysisResults,
  analysisContext // Required for display
};
```

## üìù Testing Checklist

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No API keys configured"**
- Add at least one API key in Supabase Edge Functions settings
- Restart the application after adding keys

**"Context detection failed"**
